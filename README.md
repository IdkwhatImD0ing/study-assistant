# What is IntelliConverse?
Our project aims to address the challenges faced by individuals with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and ADHD, as well as those who struggle with reading due to various situational factors. These individuals often find it difficult to comprehend written text, hindering their ability to access information and communicate effectively.

To overcome these challenges, we have developed a program that leverages Chat-GPT, a powerful language model, to provide comprehensive and accessible answers to questions. The program accommodates both typed and spoken inputs, allowing users to interact with the system in a way that suits their preferences and abilities.
Targeting the main group of people with learning disabilities, our solution enables them to receive text and speech outputs that effectively address their queries and provide the information they need. Additionally, we recognize the potential of our program to support individuals with mental health concerns. By offering a platform for expressing emotions, whether through typed or spoken input, our solution aims to provide a supportive and inclusive environment for individuals dealing with mental health challenges.
Overall, our program seeks to enhance accessibility, promote effective communication, and empower individuals with learning disabilities and mental health issues to overcome their unique challenges.

## How we built it:
### Backend Development Approach:
We built the backend using an API route with OpenAPI and integrated Chat-GPT for conversational agent capabilities. To enable text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT), we utilized React, Next.js, and Microsoft Cloud services. MongoDB was used for efficient data storage.
### Frontend Development Approach:
For the frontend, we implemented websockets for real-time communication and utilized Material UI to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Things that challenged us:
-	Testing Azure Speech to Text Backend Route: We encountered challenges while testing the integration of the Azure Speech to Text backend route. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the speech-to-text conversion posed difficulties during the development process.

-	Recording Frontend Audio for Azure Speech to Text: Capturing and recording audio in the frontend that met the specific requirements and specifications of Azure Speech to Text was a significant challenge. Achieving optimal audio quality and format compatibility was crucial for accurate transcription.
Overcoming these challenges required careful debugging, troubleshooting, and fine-tuning of the audio recording and speech-to-text conversion processes to ensure seamless integration and reliable performance.
